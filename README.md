# Apple M1 Benchmarking

This repository contains source code for 3 benchmarks intended to be run on M1 Macs for observing the performance differences between the power (Firestorm) and efficiency (Icestorm) cores. This project is my final project for [Professor Sorensen's CSE 211 course at UCSC](https://sorensenucsc.github.io/CSE211-fa2021/index.html). My blog post for this project can be found here.

Note: Each directory contains a `README.md` file with instructions on how to run each benchmark.
